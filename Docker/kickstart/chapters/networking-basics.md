# Docker Networking Basics

In this lab you'll explore Docker's networking model and the CLI commands used to manage container networks.

> **Tasks:**
>
> - [Task 1: The `docker network` command](#task-1-the-docker-network-command)
> - [Task 2: List networks](#task-2-list-networks)
> - [Task 3: Inspect a network](#task-3-inspect-a-network)
> - [Task 4: Understand network drivers](#task-4-understand-network-drivers)

## Task 1: The `docker network` command

The `docker network` command is the main command for configuring and managing container networks.

Run `docker network --help` to see the available sub-commands.

```console
$ docker network --help
Usage:  docker network COMMAND

Manage networks

Commands:
  connect     Connect a container to a network
  create      Create a network
  disconnect  Disconnect a container from a network
  inspect     Display detailed information on one or more networks
  ls          List networks
  prune       Remove all unused networks
  rm          Remove one or more networks

Run 'docker network COMMAND --help' for more information on a command.
```

The key operations are: **create** and **rm** to manage networks, **connect** and **disconnect** to attach containers, and **inspect** and **ls** to view details.

## Task 2: List networks

Run `docker network ls` to view existing container networks on your Docker host.

```console
$ docker network ls
NETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER              SCOPE
1befe23acd58        bridge              bridge              local
726ead8f4e6b        host                host                local
ef4896538cc7        none                null                local
```

Every Docker installation comes with these three default networks:

| Network | Driver | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **bridge** | bridge | Default network for containers. Provides isolated networking on a single host via a Linux bridge (virtual switch). |
| **host** | host | Removes network isolation — the container shares the host's network stack directly. |
| **none** | null | No networking. The container has a loopback interface only. |

Each network has a unique `ID` and `NAME`, and is associated with a single driver. Notice that the "bridge" and "host" networks share the same name as their respective drivers.

## Task 3: Inspect a network

Use `docker network inspect` to view configuration details of a network. These details include the name, ID, driver, subnet info, connected containers, and more.

```console
$ docker network inspect bridge
[
    {
        "Name": "bridge",
        "Id": "021ef0405d164d1fff9b6453fd7015dee7bcc9fa4f2d0166cbadac3db3fa0c3b",
        "Created": "2026-03-07T18:21:12.273457708Z",
        "Scope": "local",
        "Driver": "bridge",
        "EnableIPv4": true,
        "EnableIPv6": false,
        "IPAM": {
            "Driver": "default",
            "Options": null,
            "Config": [
                {
                    "Subnet": "172.17.0.0/16",
                    "Gateway": "172.17.0.1"
                }
            ]
        },
        "Internal": false,
        "Attachable": false,
        "Ingress": false,
        "ConfigFrom": {
            "Network": ""
        },
        "ConfigOnly": false,
        "Options": {
            "com.docker.network.bridge.default_bridge": "true",
            "com.docker.network.bridge.enable_icc": "true",
            "com.docker.network.bridge.enable_ip_masquerade": "true",
            "com.docker.network.bridge.host_binding_ipv4": "0.0.0.0",
            "com.docker.network.bridge.name": "docker0",
            "com.docker.network.driver.mtu": "65535"
        },
        "Labels": {},
        "Containers": {}
    }
]
```

Key things to notice:

- The **Subnet** (`172.17.0.0/16`) defines the IP range available to containers
- The **Gateway** (`172.17.0.1`) is the IP of the Linux bridge (`docker0`) on the host
- **enable_ip_masquerade** means containers can reach the internet through NAT
- **enable_icc** (inter-container communication) allows containers on this network to talk to each other

> **NOTE:** The command syntax is `docker network inspect <network>`, where `<network>` can be either the network name or ID.

## Task 4: Understand network drivers

Docker uses a pluggable networking architecture. The built-in drivers handle most use cases:

| Driver | Scope | Use Case |
|--------|-------|----------|
| **bridge** | Local | Containers on a single host that need to communicate. The most common driver. |
| **host** | Local | When you need maximum network performance and don't need isolation (container shares host networking). |
| **overlay** | Swarm | Multi-host networking for Docker Swarm services. |
| **macvlan** | Local | When containers need to appear as physical devices on the network (each gets its own MAC address). |
| **none** | Local | Disable networking entirely. |

You can see which drivers are available with `docker info`.

{% raw %}
```console
$ docker info --format '{{.Plugins.Network}}'
[bridge host ipvlan macvlan null overlay]
```
{% endraw %}

For the kickstart workshop, we'll focus on the **bridge** driver since it's the most commonly used and the foundation for understanding Docker networking.
